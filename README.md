Machine learning for thermal image detection and anomaly detection.

This project was sponsored by AltaLink as a proof of concept for using thermal cameras and machine learning software to constanly monitor their High-Voltage DC (HVDC) Valve Halls.

FLIR provided the thermal camera used to collect images of a PC under various stress conditions to train both the Convolutional Nerual Network (CNN) and Autoencoder models.

These were then used with the GUI designed for this project to provide a final deliverable product.

The results can be seen at the link below.
